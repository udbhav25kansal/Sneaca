**Duration:** ~6 minutes
**Focus:** FIFA 2026 Vancouver Strategy
**Format:** Narrative presentation

## Opening: The Big Idea (0:00:00 - 0:01:12)

You know, every once in a while, an idea comes along that's, well, it's just more than a business. It's a **story**, a big one, just waiting to unfold on a global stage. And today, we're going to dive right into the origin of a story just like that.

Just think about it for a second. **Pride, passion, identity.** These aren't just feelings, right? They're the colors you wear, the flag you wave, the song you sing at the top of your lungs. It's a language that everyone understands, whether you're in a stadium or just walking down the street.

But what if you could take all of that pride, that soul, and **wear it right on your feet?** What if a brand didn't just sell you a product, but helped you create a piece of your own identity?

Well, that brand is **Sneaca**.

---

## The Catalyst Moment (0:00:29 - 0:01:12)

Now, every great story has that one moment, that **catalyst** where everything just clicks, where potential and opportunity collide. And for Sneaca, that moment isn't just coming, it's right around the corner, and it is coming fast.

That's right, **2026, the FIFA World Cup is coming to Vancouver.**

And this is so much more than a soccer tournament. It's a massive **global wave of pride, tourism, and an absolutely huge demand for merchandise.** It is the perfect ignition point.

And that brings up a really important question. In a city that's going to be absolutely buzzing with fans from all over the world, who is taking all that raw passion and turning it into something beautiful, something crafted? **Who's looking out for these communities?**

The answer? **Nobody. Until now.**

And this is exactly where Sneaca steps in, not just as another brand, but as **the forge**, the place where all that community passion gets transformed into something real, something you can actually hold, something you can wear.

---

## What is Sneaca? (0:01:31 - 0:02:22)

So what is Sneaca really? Think of it like this. It's a **turnkey, design-to-door, custom footwear service.** We give brands, teams, and creators the power to bring their own limited-run shoes to life. We handle everything, the whole shebang, from that first spark of an idea all the way to the final delivery.

### The Three-Step Engine:

You give us an idea, and we turn it into a design proof in just **72 hours**. Yep, 72 hours.

**2. Precision Manufacturing**

**3. Global Delivery**

It's this seamless blend of pure creativity and rock-solid logistics.

---

## The Canvas (0:02:22 - 0:02:44)

And the canvas you get to play with is just incredible. Our first phase of products has it all:
- Classic low tops
- Casual slip-ons
- Slides
- Court-style
- Casual runners

### Customization Options:

And the customization, it's **deep**. We're talking:
- Full panel prints
- Custom patches
- Embroidery
- Laser-printed logos/names
- Lace and eyelet colors
- Even branded boxes

**This is not just slapping a logo on a shoe. It's building your shoe from the ground up.**

---

## The Battle Plan: FIFA Community Capsule (0:02:44 - 0:03:34)

Okay, so a huge vision is one thing, but you need a brilliant plan of attack to make it real. For Sneaca, the proof is going to be right in the heart of the action. **Vancouver, 2026.**

### The Strategy: FIFA Community Capsule

The plan is to launch **five limited-run sneaker collections** that celebrate some of Vancouver's most passionate soccer communities:
- Brazil
- Ukraine
- Italy
- Iran
- [Fifth community]

**This isn't just a product drop. It's a full-on cultural event.**

### Positioning: "Wear Your Colors"

That's it. These are designs that are proud of the city that reflect real heritage and quality.

### Launch Strategy:

- Stunning AI mock-ups
- Exclusive pre-order drops
- Partner deep with local cultural clubs

**It's all about authenticity.**

---

## The 90-Day Sprint (0:03:34 - 0:03:54)

And we're not waiting around. The execution is fast. A **90-day sprint**, not a five-year crawl.

### Timeline:

**Day 0-7:** Website goes live
**Day 8-30:** Partners are activated
**Day 31-60:** First capsules drop
**Day 61-90:** Hit milestone

### The Goal:

**$100,000 in booked revenue inside the first 90 days.**

It's ambitious, it's fast, and it's absolutely doable.

---

## Two-Pronged Market Approach (0:03:54 - 0:04:24)

The approach here is really smart. It's a **two-pronged attack**:

### Track 1: Licensed
- Official FIFA licenses
- Fan shops
- VIP gifting
- Venue staff footwear

### Track 2: Non-Licensed
- City-inspired capsules
- Hotel collaborations
- Grassroots community partnerships

**This way we capture the whole market** from the official channels to the grassroots energy.

---

## The Business Engine (0:04:24 - 0:05:06)

Okay, so a powerful vision is one thing, but a sustainable business is something else entirely. So let's pop the hood and look at the engine that's going to power this whole movement.

### Pricing Model: Transparent & Scalable

Our pricing model is super transparent and it's built to scale. It doesn't matter if our partners are ordering:
- A small batch of 50
- OR a huge run of over 1,000

**The value is obvious.** This structure means that small communities and big brands can all be a part of this.

### Financial Health: High-Margin from Day One

And the financial health of this business is strong, right from the start. We're targeting a **gross margin of 50% or more.**

So yeah, this isn't just a passion project, it's a **high margin, scalable business model from day one.** The numbers work.

---

## Operational Excellence (0:05:06 - 0:05:21)

### Major Goal #1: Revenue & Margin

The first major operational goal is crystal clear:
- **$150,000 in booked revenue**
- **Gross margin at 48% or higher**

This is all about disciplined, smart growth.

### Major Goal #2: Speed as Competitive Edge

And this right here, this is a huge operational advantage. An **average lead time of 45 days or less** for air delivery.

In a world of hype drops and fast moving culture, that kind of speed and predictability is a **massive, massive competitive edge.**

---

## The Moat: Four Pillars of Defense (0:05:21 - 0:05:38)

## The Global Vision (0:05:38 - 0:06:04)

Look, **the FIFA World Cup is the launch pad, not the final destination.**

From Vancouver, this model is built to scale to:
- Every city
- Every team
- Every single community that has a story to tell

**That is the global vision.**

Because when you really boil it all down, you realize the most important thing:

**This was never just about shoes.**

It's about **identity.**
It's about **belonging.**
It's a **movement of communities**, all learning to wear their soul.
