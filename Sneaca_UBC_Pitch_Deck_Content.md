**Duration:** ~15 seconds

### Content:
**SNEACA**
*Custom Footwear That Tells Your Story*

**Team:**
[Your Name], Founder

**Tagline:**
"Wear Your Colors. Wear Your Soul."

---

## Slide 2: Team
**Duration:** ~30 seconds

### Talking Points:

**Founder Background:**
- Background in [your background]
- Identified massive gap in custom merchandise market
- Family connection to world-class shoe manufacturing

**Our Unfair Advantage:**
- Direct access to one of India's largest shoe manufacturing facilities
- Family ownership ensures guaranteed capacity, priority production
- Cutting-edge facility with small-batch expertise
- Built-in trust, reliability, and cost advantages

**Why We're Positioned to Win:**
This isn't just another startup trying to build supplier relationships — we OWN the factory access that competitors would spend years trying to secure.

---

## Slide 3: Venture Name & 60-Second Intro
**Duration:** ~60 seconds

### Elevator Pitch:

"Hi, I'm [Your Name], and this is **Sneaca**.

My team and I saw that custom merchandise is everywhere — t-shirts, hats, water bottles — all available in small batches of 25-50 units with 7-14 day turnaround.

But when you want **custom shoes**? You hit a wall. Traditional manufacturers demand 1,000+ pairs, 120+ day lead times, and massive upfront costs. For communities, corporations, and creators who want to tell their story through custom footwear, **it's essentially impossible**.

**Sneaca solves this.**

We're a turnkey, design-to-door custom footwear service. We make it possible to order just **40-50 pairs of custom sneakers** or **50 pairs of custom flip-flops**, delivered in **45 days**, with full design customization.

What makes us different? My family owns one of the largest shoe manufacturing facilities in India. We have **guaranteed factory access**, **cost advantages**, and **production expertise** that our competitors simply cannot match.

We're not just selling shoes — we're giving communities, brands, and creators the power to wear their identity."

---

## Slide 4: Problem
**Duration:** ~30 seconds

### The Problem:

**Custom merchandise is ubiquitous — except for footwear.**

**Current Reality:**
- Custom t-shirts: ✓ 25-50 MOQ, 7-14 days
- Custom hats: ✓ 25-50 MOQ, 7-14 days
- Custom water bottles: ✓ 25-50 MOQ, 7-14 days
- **Custom shoes: ✗ 1,000+ MOQ, 120+ days, $50K+ investment**

**Who's Affected:**
- Sports teams wanting custom team shoes
- Tech companies wanting branded footwear for events
- Cultural communities celebrating heritage through fashion
- Hotels and resorts wanting luxury guest amenities
- Universities wanting custom campus footwear
- Influencers wanting private-label shoe lines

**The Gap:**
These organizations have **passion, identity, and stories to tell** — but no accessible way to express it through custom footwear at reasonable volumes.

---

## Slide 5: Customer
**Duration:** ~30 seconds

### Our Target Customers (3 Primary Segments):

**1. Communities & Associations (Segment #1)**
- Tech communities (Product Hunt Vancouver, Shopify partners)

- **Volume:** 100-500 pairs per order

---

## Slide 6: How Problem is Solved Today
**Duration:** ~45 seconds

### Current Alternatives (None Are Good):

**Option 1: Traditional Footwear Manufacturers**
- **MOQ:** 1,000-5,000 pairs minimum
- **Timeline:** 120-180 days
- **Cost:** $30K-$100K+ upfront investment
- **Why It Fails:** Too expensive, too slow, too risky for most organizations

**Option 2: Print-on-Demand Services**
- **Examples:** Printful, Printify
- **Offering:** Limited slip-ons with printed insoles/uppers
- **Why It Fails:** Poor quality, limited customization, no true "custom" manufacturing

**Option 3: Promotional Product Distributors**
- **Examples:** 4imprint, Vistaprint
- **Offering:** Pre-made shoes with simple logo embroidery
- **Why It Fails:** No design freedom, generic products, doesn't solve custom footwear need

**Option 4: Do Nothing**
- Order custom t-shirts, hats, bags instead
- **Why It Fails:** Misses the emotional impact and premium positioning that custom footwear provides

**The Reality:**
For small-batch custom footwear (50-500 pairs), **there is no good solution today**. Customers either:
- Compromise on generic promotional products
- Over-order (1,000+ pairs) and take on massive risk
- Give up entirely and stick to apparel

**This is the gap Sneaca fills.**
