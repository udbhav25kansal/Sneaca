**Custom Footwear That Tells Your Story**

## 🎯 What is Sneaca?

Sneaca is a turnkey, design-to-door custom footwear service that makes small-batch production accessible. We enable brands, teams, and creators to order just **40-50 pairs of custom sneakers** or **50 pairs of custom flip-flops**, delivered in **45 days**, with full design customization.

### The Problem We Solve

Custom merchandise is everywhere — t-shirts, hats, water bottles — all available in small batches. But custom footwear? It requires 1,000+ pairs, 120+ day lead times, and massive upfront investment. **Until now.**

### Our Unfair Advantage

Family ownership of one of India's largest shoe manufacturing facilities, providing:
- ✅ Guaranteed production capacity
- ✅ Cost advantages (factory-direct)
- ✅ Small-batch expertise (50-2,000 pairs)
- ✅ Predictable quality and delivery

## 🎤 Quick Elevator Pitch

**30 seconds:**

"You know how custom t-shirts and hats are easy to order in batches of 50? Custom shoes don't work that way — they require 1,000+ pairs and 4+ months. **Sneaca changes that.** We make it possible to order just 40-50 pairs of fully custom sneakers, delivered in 45 days. We can do this because my family owns a major shoe factory in India. We're launching with FIFA 2026 community capsules in Vancouver, then scaling to corporations, hotels, and sports teams across Canada."

## 🏆 Why Sneaca Will Win

1. **Unfair Advantage**: Family-owned factory access (5-10 year moat)
2. **Market Gap**: No viable small-batch footwear solution exists
3. **Perfect Timing**: FIFA 2026 provides catalyzing moment
4. **Proven Demand**: Custom merchandise market validates willingness to pay
5. **Strong Economics**: 48-52% margins, made-to-order model
