## Your Unfair Advantage (The Hook)

**Core Message:**
"My family owns one of the largest shoe manufacturing facilities in India. We have guaranteed factory access, cost advantages, and production expertise that competitors simply cannot match. This isn't a startup trying to build supplier relationships — we OWN the supply chain."

**Why It Matters:**
- Competitors need 5+ years to build this
- Can't be copied or bought
- Ensures capacity, quality, priority

## Handling Common Objections

### Q: "Can your factory handle the demand?"
**A:** "Great question. The factory produces 50,000+ pairs per month. Our Year 1 target is ~10,000 pairs total — less than 1% of capacity. Scalability is not a constraint."

### Q: "Why can't competitors just find their own factory?"
**A:** "Building trusted factory relationships takes 5-7 years. Most factories won't prioritize 50-200 pair runs because it's operationally complex. Our family connection ensures priority access and specialized small-batch SOPs that take years to develop."

### Q: "Isn't FIFA 2026 a short-term opportunity?"
**A:** "FIFA is our **beachhead**, not our business. It's a high-visibility launch moment that proves our quality and execution. Our core business is custom footwear for communities, corporations, and hospitality — FIFA just gives us concentrated demand to establish credibility."

### Q: "What about quality control?"
**A:** "We target 98.5%+ First Pass Yield with pre-production sample approval, QA checkpoints at every stage, and family reputation ensuring attention to detail. Our factory's existing quality standards are world-class."

### Q: "How will you acquire customers?"
**A:** "Three channels: (1) Partnerships with 10 promo agencies and FIFA venues, (2) Outbound sales with 2 BDRs targeting 200 accounts, (3) Content marketing showcasing use cases and AI mockups. FIFA community capsules seed our brand with cultural organizations."

### Q: "What if production costs increase?"
**A:** "We've built margin protection into our pricing tiers with cost ceilings. For example, at the $55 tier, our landed cost ceiling is $27.50 to maintain 50% margin. We also have setup fees for high-volume tiers to protect margin structure."

### Q: "Who are your direct competitors?"
**A:** "There are no direct competitors serving the 40-500 pair segment. Traditional manufacturers require 1,000+ pairs. Promotional distributors offer generic stock items with logo embroidery, not true custom manufacturing. We're filling a white space."

## Post-Presentation Strategy

### During Q&A:
1. **Listen fully** before answering
2. **Repeat question** if unclear or to buy time
3. **Answer concisely** — 30-60 seconds max per question
4. **Bridge back** to your strengths ("That's a great question, and it actually highlights our unfair advantage...")

### If You Don't Know:
"That's a great question. I don't have that data with me, but here's what I do know... [related information]. I'd be happy to follow up with specifics after the interview."

### Closing Strong:
"Thank you for your time today. To summarize: we're solving a real problem that affects thousands of organizations, we have an unfair advantage that can't be replicated, and FIFA 2026 gives us the perfect launch moment. We're asking for $50K to prove this model in Vancouver, then scale across Canada and beyond. I'd love to answer any final questions."

## Emergency Backup Talking Points

### If Asked About Risks:
"The biggest risks are: (1) production delays, which we mitigate through family oversight and direct factory communication, (2) customer acquisition, which we address through partnerships and proven outbound playbook, and (3) margin compression, which we protect through tiered pricing with built-in cost ceilings."

### If Asked About Team:
"Right now it's [describe team]. As we scale, our first hires will be: (1) BDR/Sales rep to drive outbound, (2) Operations coordinator to manage production tracking, and (3) Designer to handle mockups and tech packs."

### If Asked About Long-Term Vision:
"Year 1-2 is proving the model in Vancouver and Canadian FIFA cities. Year 3-5 is geographic expansion to US markets and vertical expansion into sports teams, universities, music festivals. Year 5-10 is building a self-serve platform where creators and small brands can design and order directly. The vision is to be the Shopify of custom footwear."

---

## The One Thing to Remember

**If you forget everything else, remember this:**

**"Sneaca makes custom footwear accessible at 40-50 pairs instead of 1,000+, delivered in 45 days instead of 120+. We can do this because my family owns the factory — an unfair advantage that takes competitors 5+ years to build. FIFA 2026 in Vancouver is our launch moment to prove quality and execution before scaling across Canada."**

## Confidence Builders

### You Have:
✅ A real problem with clear market validation
✅ A unique solution with defensible moat
✅ An unfair advantage (factory access)
✅ A catalyzing moment (FIFA 2026)
✅ Proven demand (custom merch market growth)
✅ Clear path to revenue ($100K in 90 days)
✅ Realistic financial targets (48%+ margin)

### Why You'll Win:
1. **You OWN the supply chain** (competitors don't)
2. **You're solving a real pain** (not a nice-to-have)
3. **You have a forcing function** (FIFA creates urgency)
4. **You're capital efficient** (made-to-order, no inventory)
5. **You're thinking big** (this is $15-20M market, not $500K)

---

## Final Pep Talk

You're not asking for permission to try something risky. You're offering Innovation UBC a front-row seat to a category-defining business at the exact moment when:

- The market is ready (custom merch is mainstream)
- The supply chain is ready (factory capacity exists)
- The moment is right (FIFA 2026 in Vancouver)

You have the unfair advantage. You have the market. You have the timing.

Now go tell the story.

**Duration:** 7 minutes
**Impact:** Lifetime

Good luck! 🚀
