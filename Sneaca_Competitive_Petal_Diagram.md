## Strategic Positioning

### Sneaca's Unique Position:

**We are NOT:**
- ❌ A traditional manufacturer (we're accessible, not bulk-only)
- ❌ A promotional distributor (we're custom, not catalog)
- ❌ Print-on-demand (we're manufacturing, not printing)
- ❌ A consumer brand (we're B2B, not D2C)

**We ARE:**
- ✅ The first accessible custom footwear manufacturer for small batches
- ✅ A B2B service enabling organizations to create branded footwear
- ✅ A bridge between "generic promo products" and "expensive custom manufacturing"

## Investor Insight: Why This Matters

### Key Takeaway for Pitch:
"We've identified a **$850M white space** in the promotional products and custom merchandise market. Organizations want custom footwear, but existing solutions require either 1,000+ pair minimums or sacrifice quality. Sneaca fills this gap with accessible MOQs (40-50 pairs), fast turnaround (45 days), and factory-grade quality — made possible by our unfair advantage: family-owned manufacturing access."

### Defensibility:
- **High barriers to entry:** Factory relationships take 5-10 years to build
- **Operational complexity:** Small-batch SOPs require specialized expertise
- **First-mover advantage:** No direct competitors in the 40-500 pair segment
- **Network effects:** As we grow, brand reputation and customer case studies create flywheel

### Scalability:
- **Proven demand:** Custom merchandise market growing 7-9% annually
- **Repeatable model:** Same playbook works across geographies and verticals
- **Expanding TAM:** New use cases emerge as customers see possibilities
- **Platform potential:** Future self-serve design tools for SMBs and creators
