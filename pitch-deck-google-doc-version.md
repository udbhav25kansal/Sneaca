# SNEACA
## Custom Footwear That Tells Your Story

**"Wear Your Colors. Wear Your Soul."**

*Presented by: Udbhav Kansal, Founder*

---

## Slide 1: Our Team & Unfair Advantage

### Founder Background
- Identified massive gap in custom merchandise market
- Family connection to world-class manufacturing
- Deep understanding of B2B footwear needs

### Our Unfair Advantage

**Direct access to one of India's largest shoe manufacturing facilities**
- Family ownership ensures guaranteed capacity & priority production
- Built-in trust, reliability, and cost advantages

**Why We're Positioned to Win:** This isn't another startup trying to build supplier relationships — we OWN the factory access that competitors would spend years trying to secure.

---

## Slide 2: What is Sneaca?

### The Reality
Custom merchandise is everywhere — t-shirts, hats, water bottles — all available in small batches of 25-50 units with 7-14 day turnaround.

### The Problem
**But when you want custom shoes?** You hit a wall. Traditional manufacturers demand 1,000+ pairs, 120+ day lead times, and massive upfront costs.

For communities, corporations, and creators who want to tell their story through custom footwear, **it's essentially impossible.**

### Sneaca Solves This
We're a turnkey, design-to-door custom footwear service. Order just **40-50 pairs of custom sneakers** or **50 pairs of flip-flops**, delivered in **45 days**, with full design customization.

### What Makes Us Different
My family owns one of the largest shoe manufacturing facilities in India. We have **guaranteed factory access**, **cost advantages**, and **production expertise** that competitors simply cannot match.

---

## Slide 3: The Problem

Custom merchandise is ubiquitous — except for footwear.

![The Custom Merchandise Gap - Accessible custom merch vs. inaccessible custom footwear](problem-custom-footwear-accessibility-gap.png)

### Comparison:
- ✓ **Custom T-Shirts:** 25-50 MOQ • 7-14 days
- ✓ **Custom Hats:** 25-50 MOQ • 7-14 days
- ✓ **Custom Water Bottles:** 25-50 MOQ • 7-14 days
- ✗ **Custom Shoes:** 1,000+ MOQ • 120+ days • $50K+ investment

### Who's Affected:
- Sports Teams
- Tech Companies
- Cultural Communities
- Hotels & Resorts
- Universities
- Influencers

These organizations have **passion, identity, and stories to tell** — but no accessible way to express it through custom footwear at reasonable volumes.

---

## Slide 4: Our Target Customers

### 1. Communities & Associations
- **Description:** Tech communities, sports leagues, cultural associations
- **Use Case:** Limited-edition team shoes, cultural celebration footwear
- **Volume:** 50-250 pairs per order

### 2. Corporations & Hospitality
- **Description:** Startups, tech companies, hotels, resorts, spas, restaurants
- **Use Case:** Employee gifting, corporate events, guest experiences
- **Volume:** 100-500 pairs per order

### 3. FIFA 2026 Beachhead
- **Description:** Vancouver's soccer-loving communities (Brazil, Ukraine, Italy, Iran, Portugal)
- **Use Case:** Community pride capsules, event merchandise, tourism products
- **Volume:** 200-500 pairs per capsule

### Why These Segments?
- Clear identity and storytelling needs
- Budget to invest in quality merchandise
- Events and milestones requiring custom products
- Proven demand for custom branded items

---

## Slide 5: How Problem is Solved Today

None of these alternatives are good:

### Option 1: Traditional Manufacturers
- **MOQ:** 1,000-5,000 pairs
- **Timeline:** 120-180 days
- **Cost:** $30K-$100K+ upfront
- ❌ Too expensive, too slow, too risky for most organizations

### Option 2: Print-on-Demand Services
- **Examples:** Printful, Printify
- **Offering:** Limited slip-ons with printed insoles/uppers
- ❌ Poor quality, limited customization, no true "custom" manufacturing

### Option 3: Promotional Product Distributors
- **Examples:** 4imprint, Vistaprint
- **Offering:** Pre-made shoes with simple logo embroidery
- ❌ No design freedom, generic products

### Option 4: Do Nothing
- Order custom t-shirts, hats, bags instead
- ❌ Misses emotional impact and premium positioning of custom footwear

**For small-batch custom footwear (50-500 pairs), there is no good solution today.** This is the gap Sneaca fills.

---

## Slide 6: Our Solution — What We Built

### What Was Impossible Is Now Possible

**We created the first turnkey system that makes custom footwear accessible at small volumes — transforming what was once a $50,000, 120-day barrier into a simple 50-pair, 45-day reality.**

### How We Make It Possible: Our Unfair Advantage

**This isn't a business model innovation — it's a manufacturing capability breakthrough.**

#### The "Impossible" Challenge:
Custom footwear in small batches requires:
- Flexible production lines willing to run <1,000 pairs (most factories refuse)
- Technical expertise in shoe construction and quality control
- Speed without sacrificing quality
- Predictable costs at low volumes

**Most startups spend years trying to find a factory partner. We already own the access.**

#### Our Moat (Cannot Be Replicated):

**1. Exclusive Manufacturing Access**
- My father owns one of India's largest shoe manufacturing facilities
- I have **exclusive North American rights** to this world-class, just-in-time production
- **21 years of built trust** — guaranteed capacity, priority production, cost advantages
- Access to the **world's most advanced automated flip-flop production line**

**2. Deep Domain Expertise**
- 3 years hands-on footwear manufacturing experience
- Trained by **Arc'teryx founders** (world-class footwear makers)
- Facilitated Shoes × MistyWest collaboration
- AI implementation consulting for manufacturing
- Understanding of both design innovation AND production operations

**3. Small-Batch SOPs Built Over Years**
- Purpose-built processes for 40-2,000 pair runs
- Most factories optimize for 5,000+ pairs
- Our sweet spot is where competitors have a gap

**4. Speed + Quality Combination**
- **45-day delivery** with ≥98.5% First Pass Yield

**Our defensibility comes from:**
1. **Exclusive manufacturing rights** (contractual, not patent-based)
2. **21-year family relationship** (trust-based, not replicable)
3. **Domain expertise** (experience-based, not protectable)
4. **Just-in-time production capability** (operational advantage)

**UBC IP:** No UBC intellectual property involved — all manufacturing relationships and expertise pre-date any UBC affiliation.

**Red Thread Club Pilot (Our First Customer):**
- **$600 revenue** in custom flip-flops
- **70% gross margin** (exceptional unit economics)

### Why This Matters: The Transformation

**Before Sneaca:**
- Want custom shoes for your 100-person community? Impossible.

**With Sneaca:**

**The gap we're closing:** Making custom footwear as accessible as custom t-shirts.

## Key Takeaway

**Sneaca isn't selling shoes — we're selling solidarity, identity, and belonging.**

When a community wears matching custom shoes:
- They feel connected to something bigger
- They create memorable shared experiences
- They show pride in their group
- They build lasting bonds

**And now, for the first time, they actually can.**
