**"Wear Your Colors. Wear Your Soul."**

*Presented by: Udbhav Kansal, Founder*

## Slide 1: Our Team & Unfair Advantage

### Founder Background
- Identified massive gap in custom merchandise market
- Family connection to world-class manufacturing
- Deep understanding of B2B footwear needs

### Our Unfair Advantage

**Direct access to one of India's largest shoe manufacturing facilities**
- Family ownership ensures guaranteed capacity & priority production
- Built-in trust, reliability, and cost advantages

**Why We're Positioned to Win:** This isn't another startup trying to build supplier relationships — we OWN the factory access that competitors would spend years trying to secure.

---

## Slide 2: What is Sneaca?

### The Reality
Custom merchandise is everywhere — t-shirts, hats, water bottles — all available in small batches of 25-50 units with 7-14 day turnaround.

### The Problem
**But when you want custom shoes?** You hit a wall. Traditional manufacturers demand 1,000+ pairs, 120+ day lead times, and massive upfront costs.

For communities, corporations, and creators who want to tell their story through custom footwear, **it's essentially impossible.**

### Sneaca Solves This
We're a turnkey, design-to-door custom footwear service. Order just **40-50 pairs of custom sneakers** or **50 pairs of flip-flops**, delivered in **45 days**, with full design customization.

### What Makes Us Different
My family owns one of the largest shoe manufacturing facilities in India. We have **guaranteed factory access**, **cost advantages**, and **production expertise** that competitors simply cannot match.

## Slide 3: The Problem

Custom merchandise is ubiquitous — except for footwear.

### Comparison:
- ✓ **Custom T-Shirts:** 25-50 MOQ • 7-14 days
- ✓ **Custom Hats:** 25-50 MOQ • 7-14 days
- ✓ **Custom Water Bottles:** 25-50 MOQ • 7-14 days
- ✗ **Custom Shoes:** 1,000+ MOQ • 120+ days • $50K+ investment

### Who's Affected:
- Sports Teams
- Tech Companies
- Cultural Communities
- Hotels & Resorts
- Universities
- Influencers

These organizations have **passion, identity, and stories to tell** — but no accessible way to express it through custom footwear at reasonable volumes.

---

## Slide 4: Our Target Customers

### 1. Communities & Associations

- **Description:** Startups, tech companies, hotels, resorts, spas, restaurants
- **Use Case:** Employee gifting, corporate events, guest experiences

### Why These Segments?
- Clear identity and storytelling needs
- Budget to invest in quality merchandise
- Events and milestones requiring custom products
- Proven demand for custom branded items

## Slide 5: How Problem is Solved Today

None of these alternatives are good:

### Option 1: Traditional Manufacturers
- **MOQ:** 1,000-5,000 pairs
- **Timeline:** 120-180 days
- **Cost:** $30K-$100K+ upfront
- ❌ Too expensive, too slow, too risky for most organizations

### Option 2: Print-on-Demand Services
- **Examples:** Printful, Printify
- **Offering:** Limited slip-ons with printed insoles/uppers
- ❌ Poor quality, limited customization, no true "custom" manufacturing

### Option 3: Promotional Product Distributors
- **Examples:** 4imprint, Vistaprint
- **Offering:** Pre-made shoes with simple logo embroidery
- ❌ No design freedom, generic products

### Option 4: Do Nothing
- Order custom t-shirts, hats, bags instead
- ❌ Misses emotional impact and premium positioning of custom footwear

**For small-batch custom footwear (50-500 pairs), there is no good solution today.** This is the gap Sneaca fills.
