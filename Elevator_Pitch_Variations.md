# Sneaca — Elevator Pitch Variations
## Multi-Length Pitch Library for Different Contexts

---

## 10-Word Pitch
**Context:** Super quick intro, name tag, Twitter bio

### Version 1 (Product-Focused):
"Custom sneakers for communities. 40 pairs minimum. 45 days."

### Version 2 (Problem-Focused):
"Making custom footwear accessible at 40 pairs, not 1,000."

### Version 3 (Advantage-Focused):
"Family-owned factory makes small-batch custom shoes possible now."

### Version 4 (Market-Focused):
"B2B custom footwear for teams, brands, and FIFA 2026."

**Recommended:** Version 2 (most clear and compelling)

---

## 30-Second Pitch
**Context:** Networking event, quick hallway intro, casual meeting

### Version A (Problem-Solution):
"You know how custom t-shirts and hats are easy to order in batches of 50? Custom shoes don't work that way — they require 1,000+ pairs and 4+ months. **Sneaca changes that.** We make it possible to order just 40-50 pairs of fully custom sneakers, delivered in 45 days. We can do this because my family owns a major shoe factory in India. We're launching with FIFA 2026 community capsules in Vancouver, then scaling to corporations, hotels, and sports teams across Canada."

**Duration:** ~28 seconds
**Key elements:** Problem, solution, unfair advantage, initial traction

---

### Version B (Opportunity-Focused):
"Custom merchandise is a $5 billion market, but footwear has been left out because traditional manufacturers demand 1,000+ pair minimums. **Sneaca makes custom footwear accessible.** Teams, corporations, and communities can now order 40-50 pairs of fully custom shoes in 45 days — made possible by our family-owned factory in India. We're launching with FIFA 2026 in Vancouver, targeting $100K in 90 days, then expanding to hospitality, corporate, and creator markets."

**Duration:** ~30 seconds
**Key elements:** Market size, accessibility, unfair advantage, go-to-market

---

## 60-Second Pitch (The Full Slide 3)
**Context:** Formal introduction, pitch competition, investor meeting intro

### Official Version (from UBC Deck):

"Hi, I'm [Your Name], and this is **Sneaca**.

My team and I saw that custom merchandise is everywhere — t-shirts, hats, water bottles — all available in small batches of 25-50 units with 7-14 day turnaround.

But when you want **custom shoes**? You hit a wall. Traditional manufacturers demand 1,000+ pairs, 120+ day lead times, and massive upfront costs. For communities, corporations, and creators who want to tell their story through custom footwear, **it's essentially impossible**.

**Sneaca solves this.**

We're a turnkey, design-to-door custom footwear service. We make it possible to order just **40-50 pairs of custom sneakers** or **50 pairs of custom flip-flops**, delivered in **45 days**, with full design customization.

What makes us different? My family owns one of the largest shoe manufacturing facilities in India. We have **guaranteed factory access**, **cost advantages**, and **production expertise** that our competitors simply cannot match.

We're not just selling shoes — we're giving communities, brands, and creators the power to wear their identity."

**Duration:** ~58 seconds
**Key elements:** Hook, problem, solution, unfair advantage, vision

---

### Alternative 60-Second Version (Opportunity-First):

"The custom merchandise market is $5 billion and growing fast. Organizations love branded apparel — t-shirts, hats, bags — because they reinforce identity and create community.

But here's the gap: **custom footwear doesn't exist at small volumes.** Want custom shoes? You need to order 1,000+ pairs, wait 120+ days, and invest $50,000+ upfront. That's impossible for most organizations.

**Sneaca changes the game.**

We make custom footwear accessible. Order just **40-50 pairs**, get them in **45 days**, with **full design control** — colors, materials, logos, everything.

How? My family owns one of India's largest shoe factories. We have guaranteed capacity, cost advantages, and small-batch expertise that competitors take 5+ years to build.

We're launching with **FIFA 2026 community capsules** in Vancouver — targeting $100K in 90 days — then scaling to corporations, hotels, sports teams, and influencers.

**Sneaca** — wear your colors."

**Duration:** ~60 seconds
**Key elements:** Market, problem, solution, unfair advantage, traction, vision

## 2-Minute Pitch
**Context:** Pitch competition with extended time, detailed investor meeting, panel interview

### Full Version:

**[0:00-0:15] Hook & Context:**
"The custom merchandise market is $5 billion in North America and growing 7-9% annually. Organizations — from tech startups to sports teams to cultural communities — love custom products because they reinforce identity and create belonging.

**[0:15-0:35] The Problem:**
Custom apparel is easy: 25-50 t-shirts in 7-14 days. Custom hats, water bottles, bags — same thing. But custom footwear? It's broken. Traditional manufacturers demand 1,000+ pairs minimum, 120-180 day lead times, and $50,000+ upfront investment. For the vast majority of organizations, **it's simply not accessible.**

**[0:35-0:50] The Gap:**
This creates a massive gap. Sports teams want custom shoes for their players. Tech companies want branded footwear for events. Hotels want luxury custom slippers for guests. Cultural communities want to celebrate heritage through fashion. **The demand is there, but the solution isn't.**

**[0:50-1:10] The Solution:**
That's where **Sneaca** comes in. We're a turnkey, design-to-door custom footwear service. Organizations can order just **40-50 pairs of custom sneakers** or **50 pairs of flip-flops**, delivered in **45 days**. We handle everything: design mockups in 72 hours, pre-production samples in 10 days, then bulk manufacturing with 95% on-time delivery.

**[1:10-1:30] The Unfair Advantage:**
What makes this possible? My family owns one of the largest shoe manufacturing facilities in India. We have **guaranteed production capacity**, **cost advantages**, and **small-batch expertise** that traditional manufacturers simply can't match. This isn't a startup trying to build supplier relationships — we **own** the supply chain. That's a 5-10 year moat that competitors cannot easily replicate.

**[1:30-1:50] Go-to-Market & Traction:**
We're launching with **FIFA World Cup 2026 in Vancouver** as our beachhead. Five community pride capsules — Brazil, Ukraine, Italy, Iran, Portugal — celebrating Vancouver's most passionate soccer communities. This gives us concentrated demand, high visibility, and a forcing function to prove quality and execution. Our goal: **$100K in revenue in 90 days**, then expand to corporations, hospitality, sports teams, and creators across Canada.

**[1:50-2:00] The Vision:**
We're not just selling shoes. We're giving organizations the power to **wear their identity**. Sneaca — wear your colors."

**Duration:** ~2 minutes
**Key elements:** Market, problem, gap, solution, unfair advantage, GTM, traction, vision

## The "Why Now?" Elevator Pitch
**Context:** When specifically asked about timing

### 45-Second Version:
"Three things are converging right now that make this the perfect moment for Sneaca.

**First**, **FIFA 2026** is coming to Vancouver. Seven matches, 300,000+ international visitors, massive community pride and merchandise demand. It's a defined catalyzing moment with concentrated demand — the perfect proof point for our quality and execution.

**Second**, the **manufacturing capability just became available**. My family's factory completed investments in cutting-edge equipment and developed small-batch SOPs specifically for 50-2,000 pair runs. This capability didn't exist two years ago — it exists now.

**Third**, the **market is ready**. The custom merchandise market has grown from $3.6 billion to $5.1 billion in five years. Organizations are sophisticated buyers of custom products and actively looking for footwear solutions.

The timing is perfect — we have the moment, the capability, and the demand all aligned."

---

## The "Unfair Advantage" Elevator Pitch
**Context:** When asked what makes you defensible

### 45-Second Version:
"Our unfair advantage is simple: **my family owns the factory**.

Traditional startups spend 5-10 years trying to build supplier relationships, negotiate minimum orders, and ensure quality. We skip all of that because we **own** one of India's largest shoe manufacturing facilities.

This gives us four things competitors can't easily replicate:

**One**, guaranteed production capacity — we're never waiting in line.

**Two**, cost advantages — no middleman markup, factory-direct pricing.

**Three**, small-batch expertise — we've built SOPs specifically for 50-2,000 pair runs, which traditional factories can't profitably serve.

**Four**, trust and quality — family reputation ensures attention to detail and on-time delivery.

By the time competitors build comparable relationships and capabilities, we'll have brand recognition, customer testimonials, and operational excellence. This is a 5-10 year moat."

---

## The "FIFA Strategy" Elevator Pitch
**Context:** When asked about FIFA go-to-market

### 45-Second Version:
"FIFA World Cup 2026 in Vancouver is our **beachhead, not our entire business**.

Here's the strategy: Vancouver has incredibly passionate soccer-loving communities — Brazilian, Ukrainian, Italian, Iranian, Portuguese. We're launching **five limited-edition community pride capsules** — 200-500 pairs each — celebrating these communities with custom footwear. Think: Brazil colors, Ukrainian symbols, Italian heritage designs.

This gives us three things:

**One**, concentrated demand in a short window (April-June 2026 pre-tournament).

**Two**, high visibility and credibility — proving our quality on a global stage.

**Three**, partnerships with cultural clubs and FIFA-adjacent businesses (hotels near BC Place, hospitality groups).

It's a forcing function that validates our model, then we expand to the core business: corporations, sports teams, hospitality, and events across Canada and beyond."

---

## Handling the "So What?" Question

### If someone says: "That's cool, but so what? Why does this matter?"

**Response (30 seconds):**
"Think about the last time you wore a custom t-shirt from your company or team. It made you feel like you **belonged**, right? Footwear does that even more — it's personal, it's visible, it's a statement.

Until now, only massive organizations with big budgets could create custom shoes. **Sneaca democratizes that.** Now a 50-person tech startup can have custom shoes for their team. A soccer league with 100 members can celebrate their identity. A boutique hotel can offer guests luxury custom slippers.

We're not selling shoes — we're selling **identity, belonging, and pride**. And that matters to everyone."

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Too much jargon:
- Avoid: "Sneaca leverages vertical integration..."
- Better: "My family owns the factory, so we control the whole process"

### ❌ Burying the lead:
- Avoid: Starting with "The footwear industry is $365 billion globally..."
- Better: Start with the problem or the unfair advantage

### ❌ Rushing through numbers:
- Avoid: "40to50pairsin45daysfor2500dollars"
- Better: "Forty to fifty pairs... delivered in forty-five days... starting at twenty-five hundred dollars"

### ❌ Underselling the advantage:
- Avoid: "We have good supplier relationships"
- Better: "My family **owns** the factory — a 5-10 year moat"

### ❌ Forgetting the human element:
- Avoid: Purely rational/business case
- Better: "We're giving communities the power to wear their identity"
