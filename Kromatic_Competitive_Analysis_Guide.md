## Recommended Methodology: Petal Diagram

### Steve Blank's Petal Diagram Approach

**Instead of traditional X/Y axis plotting:**
- Place YOUR idea/venture at the **CENTER**
- Adjacent market segments **radiate outward** like petals
- Each petal represents a different market segment

### What Each Petal Should Include:

1. **Representative Competitors**
   - 2-5 key players per segment
   - Brief description of each

2. **Investment Data**
   - Funding rounds
   - Valuations
   - Key investors

3. **Market Size Information**
   - TAM (Total Addressable Market)
   - Growth rates
   - Market trends

### Why Petal Diagram is Better:

- Shows **multiple market segments** simultaneously
- Reveals **adjacent opportunities**
- Demonstrates **market landscape** comprehensively
- Better than 2-axis because most markets have more than 2 dimensions

**Reality:** Multiple competitors often signal healthy, growing market
