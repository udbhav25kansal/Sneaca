SNEACA
Custom Footwear That Tells Your Story

"Wear Your Colors. Wear Your Soul."

Presented by: Udbhav Kansal, Founder

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THE OPPORTUNITY

The custom merchandise market is $5.1B and growing 7% annually. T-shirts, hats, water bottles — all available in batches of 25-50 units.

But custom footwear? Impossible. Manufacturers demand 1,000+ pairs, 120+ days, and $50K+ upfront.

For communities, corporations, and creators who want custom footwear to tell their story, it is not practical.

Sneaca changes this: Less than 50 pairs. Under 45 days. Under $100 per pair.

OUR UNFAIR ADVANTAGE

Exclusive North American rights to:
   • One of India's largest shoe manufacturing facilities
   • World's most advanced automated flip-flop production line
   • 21 years of relationship built on trust, reliability, and cost advantages

Founder Background:
   • Captained Team Canada to 2nd place at Global Ocean Hackathon — first North American podium in 9 years
   • 3 years in footwear manufacturing with Arc'teryx founders
   • AI implementation consultant for manufacturing

This isn't another startup trying to build supplier relationships — we OWN the factory access competitors would spend years securing.

PROOF: WE'VE ALREADY DELIVERED

Red Thread Club Pilot:
   • $600 revenue
   • 7 days delivery (vs. industry 60-180 days)
   • 70% gross margin (vs. industry 40-50%)

This validates: market demand, pricing power, manufacturing speed, and end-to-end execution.

Path to scale: 100 similar orders = $60K revenue, $42K profit in 90 days.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Three high-value segments:

1. Communities & Associations

3. FIFA 2026 Beachhead
   Vancouver's soccer communities (Brazil, Ukraine, Italy, Iran, Portugal)

Why these? Clear identity needs, proven merch budgets, recurring events.

WHY NOW?

Three converging forces:

   7 matches, 300K+ visitors, massive merchandise demand
   Our beachhead: 5 community pride capsules

2. Manufacturing capability matured
   Family factory now has capacity and systems for 50-2,000 pair runs
   This didn't exist 2 years ago

3. Market ready
   Custom merch grew from $3.64B (2019) to $5.1B (2024)
   Footwear is the last category to democratize
