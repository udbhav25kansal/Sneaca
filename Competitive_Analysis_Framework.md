## Core Principle

> **"Any way the customer is solving the problem now is competition"**

---

## Types of Competition

### Direct Competition
- Similar products and services
- Same solution approach

### Indirect Competition
- Solving the same problem for the same target market
- Different product or service approach

**Example: Uber's Competitors**
- Direct: Lyft, other ride-sharing apps
- Indirect: Taxis, public transit, car ownership, walking

---

## Competitive Factors Framework

**What makes a customer choose one solution over another?**

### Three Main Factors:

1. **Price** – cheaper
2. **Service** – faster, personalized, convenient
3. **Quality** – lasts longer, stylish, tastes better

### **Critical Rule:**
> **At most, you can only compete on 2 out of the 3**

You cannot be the cheapest, highest quality, AND best service simultaneously.

## Unfair Advantage

**Core competency that cannot be copied or bought:**

- **Deep domain expertise** (e.g., hospital systems knowledge)
- **One amazing hard thing** (e.g., Google's search algorithm)
- **Authority** (existing reputation in market)
- **Dream Team** (previous startup success; industry rockstar)

## Creating Your Competitive Analysis

### Standard Matrix Format:

|                  | You | Competitor 1 | Competitor 2 | Competitor 3 | Competitor 4 |
|------------------|-----|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Feature 1**    |     |              |              |              |              |
| **Feature 2**    |     |              |              |              |              |
| **Feature 3**    |     |              |              |              |              |
| **Feature 4**    |     |              |              |              |              |
| **Feature 5**    |     |              |              |              |              |

## Where to Find Competitive Information

1. **Customer Discovery interviews** (most valuable)
2. Advertising
3. Sales Brochures
4. Newspapers/Magazines
5. Company Websites
6. Online review sites
7. Your business and professional network

---

## Research Tips

- **Research failed competitors** – Learn why they went out of business
- **Messy research is OK** – Your internal matrix will be detailed and messy
- **Pitch decks need summaries** – Show only strongest competitors with most important features for investor presentations

---

## Key Presentation Principle

### **Benefits sell, Features tell**

**Focus on:**
- WHAT value you provide (benefits)
- WHY customers should choose you (competitive advantage)

**Not on:**
- HOW it works technically (features)

---

## Analysis Formats

### 1. Feature Comparison Matrix
Standard table comparing you vs competitors across key features

### 2. Positioning Diagram (2-axis)
Use when there are only 2 main competitive dimensions
- Plot competitors on X/Y axes
- Shows market positioning visually
- **Still need feature matrix for detailed analysis**

### 3. Brand Analysis (for consumer products)
Compare across:
- Value Proposition
- Target Audience
- Range of Authority
- Brand Relationship
