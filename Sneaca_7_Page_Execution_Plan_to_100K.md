|----------|------------|---------------|---------------|
| 50–99    | $60        | 61.7%         | 50.0%         |

| 250–499  | $50        | 54.0%         | 40.0%         |

| 1000+    | $22        | 45.5%         |

---

## Margin Protection Strategy

### To Keep ≥50% GM, Landed Cost Must Fall To:

**Shoes:**
- $55 tier → ≤ $27.50
- $50 tier → ≤ $25.00
- $45 tier → ≤ $22.50
- $40 tier → ≤ $20.00

**Flip-flops:**
- $22 tier (1000+) needs ≤ $11 landed cost

### Tactics to Protect Margins:
1. **Quote SEA timelines** for 500+ and 1000+ by default
2. **Use AIR only with rush surcharge** (+10%)
3. **Offer Economy Spec** (materials/overlays limits) for $50 and $45 shoe tiers
4. **Add visible setup fee** ($500–$1,500) on large tiers (effectively +$1–$3/pair)
