"Wear Your Colors. Wear Your Soul."

Presented by: Udbhav Kansal, Founder

SLIDE 1: OUR TEAM & UNFAIR ADVANTAGE

Founder Background
   • Captained Team Canada & North America to 2nd place at Global Ocean Hackathon in France — first North American podium finish in 9-year history
   • 3 years in footwear manufacturing, learned from top makers including Arc'teryx founders. Facilitated Shoes collaboration with MistyWest
   • AI implementation consultant for manufacturing
   • Exclusive North American rights to world-class, just-in-time manufacturing

Our Unfair Advantage

Exclusive direct access to one of India's largest shoe manufacturing facilities and world's most advanced automated flip-flop production line
   • Guaranteed capacity & priority production rights
   • 21 years of relationship built on trust, reliability, and cost advantages

Why We're Positioned to Win: This isn't another startup trying to build supplier relationships — we OWN the factory access that competitors would spend years trying to secure.

SLIDE 2: WHAT IS SNEACA?

The Reality
Custom merchandise is everywhere — t-shirts, hats, water bottles — typically available only in small batches (eg., 25-50 units) with *long fulfillment times (in today's Amazon and instant gratification culture, the minimum 7-14 day turnaround times are considered long).

The Problem
But what about custom shoes? You hit a wall. Shoe manufacturers demand MOQ (minimum order quantities) of at least 1,000+ pairs, with average fulfillment in 120+ day lead times, and large upfront costs.

For communities, corporations, and 'creators' who want to include custom footwear as part of how they tell their story, it is not practical.

Sneaca Solves This
We're a turnkey, design-to-door custom footwear service that has innovated the shoe manufacturing process. Order less than 50 pairs of custom designed sneakers or flip-flops, and have them delivered in under 45 days, in under $100 per pair.

What Makes Us Different
We have guaranteed exclusive factory access for the North American market, giving us cost advantages, and production process expertise that competitors simply cannot match.

SLIDE 3: THE PROBLEM

Custom merchandise is ubiquitous — except for footwear.

Comparison:
   ✓ Custom T-Shirts: 25-50 MOQ • 7-14 days
   ✓ Custom Hats: 25-50 MOQ • 7-14 days
   ✓ Custom Water Bottles: 25-50 MOQ • 7-14 days
   ✗ Custom Shoes: 1,000+ MOQ • 120+ days • $50K+ investment

Who's Affected:
   • Sports Teams
   • Tech Companies
   • Cultural Communities
   • Hotels & Resorts
   • Universities
   • Influencers

These organizations have passion, identity, and stories to tell — but no accessible way to express it through custom footwear at reasonable volumes.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SLIDE 4: TARGET CUSTOMERS

1. Communities & Associations
   Tech communities, sports leagues, cultural groups seeking limited-edition footwear
   Min 50 pairs per order

2. Corporations & Hospitality
   Startups, tech companies, hotels, resorts — employee gifts, corporate events, guest experiences

3. FIFA 2026 Beachhead
   Vancouver's soccer communities (Brazil, Ukraine, Italy, Iran, Portugal) during 7 matches, 300K+ visitors

Why? Clear identity needs, proven merch budgets, recurring events.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SLIDE 5: COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE

No one operates in our sweet spot:

Traditional Manufacturers: 1,000+ MOQ, 120-180 days, $30K+ upfront
Print-on-Demand (Printful, Printify): Poor quality, limited customization
Promotional Distributors (4imprint, Vistaprint): No design freedom, generic products

For small-batch custom footwear (less than 500 pairs), no solution exists. This is the gap Sneaca fills.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SLIDE 6: HOW SNEACA WORKS

72 hours: AI-powered design proof
10 days: Physical sample for approval
30-45 days: Manufacturing and delivery

Result: 40-2,000 pairs delivered with 98.5% First Pass Yield, 95%+ on-time delivery.

Products: Sneakers, slip-ons, slides, flip-flops
Customization: Full-panel prints, embroidery, laser logos, custom packaging

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SLIDE 7: PROOF — WE'VE ALREADY DELIVERED

Red Thread Club Pilot:
   $600 revenue | 7 days delivery | 70% gross margin

This validates:
   • Market demand for small-batch custom footwear
   • Speed advantage: 7 days vs. competitors' 60-180 days
   • Unit economics: 70% margin vs. industry 40-50%
   • End-to-end execution from design to delivery

Path to scale: 100 similar orders = $60K revenue, $42K profit in 90 days.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SLIDE 8: WHY NOW?

Three converging forces:

1. FIFA 2026 in Vancouver
   7 matches, 300K+ visitors — our beachhead with 5 community pride capsules

2. Manufacturing Capability Matured
   Factory capacity and systems for 50-2,000 pair runs — didn't exist 2 years ago

3. Market Ready
   Custom merch grew from $3.64B (2019) to $5.1B (2024) — footwear is the last category to democratize

FIFA 2026 is our ignition point: high visibility, passionate communities, concentrated demand.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SLIDE 9: MARKET OPPORTUNITY

TAM: $5.1B (promotional products, growing 7% annually)
SAM: $850M (organizations ordering 50-2,000 custom units)
SOM: $15-20M (Year 1-3, Vancouver + Canada)

Year 1 Revenue Path ($375K-$700K):
   FIFA communities: $200-300K
   Corporations: $450-750K
   Hospitality: $200-400K

Why? Underserved market, proven demand, premium positioning (2-3x apparel prices), high retention.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SLIDE 10: COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE

Traditional Manufacturers: 1,000+ MOQ, 120-180 days, $15-25/pair
Promotional Distributors: 100-500 MOQ, 60-90 days, $40-80/pair

We win on: 50-pair MOQ, 45-day delivery, true custom manufacturing

Our moat:
   • Exclusive factory access (cannot be replicated)
   • Small-batch expertise (5+ years to build)
   • 7-day delivery capability (proven with 70% margins)
   • 98.5% First Pass Yield, 95%+ on-time delivery

We compete on Service + Quality. Our speed and reliability are unmatched.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SLIDE 11: BUSINESS MODEL

Pricing (CAD, Wholesale):
   Sneakers: $40-60/pair (50-1,000+ pairs)
   Flip-flops: $22-30/pair (50-1,000+ pairs)

Unit Economics (100-pair order at $55):
   Revenue: $5,500 | Costs: $3,600 | Gross Margin: $1,900 (34.5%)
   Target: 48-52%

Path to $100K (90 days): 38-40 orders across sneakers and flip-flops

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
