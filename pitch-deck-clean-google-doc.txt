SLIDE 1: OUR TEAM & UNFAIR ADVANTAGE

Founder Background
   • Captained Team Canada & North America to 2nd place at Global Ocean Hackathon in France — first North American podium finish in 9-year history
   • 3 years in footwear manufacturing, learned from top makers including Arc'teryx founders. Facilitated Shoes collaboration with MistyWest
   • AI implementation consultant for manufacturing
   • Exclusive North American rights to world-class, just-in-time manufacturing

Our Unfair Advantage

Exclusive direct access to one of India's largest shoe manufacturing facilities and world's most advanced automated flip-flop production line
   • Guaranteed capacity & priority production rights
   • 21 years of relationship built on trust, reliability, and cost advantages

Why We're Positioned to Win: This isn't another startup trying to build supplier relationships — we OWN the factory access that competitors would spend years trying to secure.

SLIDE 2: WHAT IS SNEACA?

The Reality
Custom merchandise is everywhere — t-shirts, hats, water bottles — typically available only in small batches (eg., 25-50 units) with *long fulfillment times (in today's Amazon and instant gratification culture, the minimum 7-14 day turnaround times are considered long).

The Problem
But what about custom shoes? You hit a wall. Shoe manufacturers demand MOQ (minimum order quantities) of at least 1,000+ pairs, with average fulfillment in 120+ day lead times, and large upfront costs.

For communities, corporations, and 'creators' who want to include custom footwear as part of how they tell their story, it is not practical.

Sneaca Solves This
We're a turnkey, design-to-door custom footwear service that has innovated the shoe manufacturing process. Order less than 50 pairs of custom designed sneakers or flip-flops, and have them delivered in under 45 days, in under $100 per pair.

What Makes Us Different
We have guaranteed exclusive factory access for the North American market, giving us cost advantages, and production process expertise that competitors simply cannot match.

SLIDE 3: THE PROBLEM

Custom merchandise is ubiquitous — except for footwear.

Comparison:
   ✓ Custom T-Shirts: 25-50 MOQ • 7-14 days
   ✓ Custom Hats: 25-50 MOQ • 7-14 days
   ✓ Custom Water Bottles: 25-50 MOQ • 7-14 days
   ✗ Custom Shoes: 1,000+ MOQ • 120+ days • $50K+ investment

Who's Affected:
   • Sports Teams
   • Tech Companies
   • Cultural Communities
   • Hotels & Resorts
   • Universities
   • Influencers

These organizations have passion, identity, and stories to tell — but no accessible way to express it through custom footwear at reasonable volumes.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SLIDE 4: WHO NEEDS THIS?

Communities, corporations, and hospitality groups with identity to express and budgets to spend — but nowhere to go for custom footwear at reasonable volumes.

Our beachhead: FIFA 2026 in Vancouver. 7 matches, 300K+ visitors, passionate soccer communities ready to wear their colors.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SLIDE 5: WE'VE ALREADY DELIVERED

Red Thread Club: $600 revenue | 7 days | 70% margin

This proves the model works. Now we scale.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SLIDE 6: HOW IT WORKS

Design proof → Sample → Delivery

Under 45 days from concept to door. Full customization. 50-2,000 pairs.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SLIDE 7: WHY NOW?

FIFA 2026 hits Vancouver in 18 months. Our factory capability matured last year. The custom merch market is ready.

This is our moment.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SLIDE 8: THE OPPORTUNITY

$5.1B custom merchandise market — but footwear remains inaccessible.

We're creating the category for small-batch custom footwear.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SLIDE 9: OUR MOAT

Others can't do small batches. We own exclusive factory access.

They need 1,000 pairs and 120 days. We deliver 50 pairs in 45 days.

This advantage cannot be replicated.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SLIDE 10: BUSINESS MODEL

B2B wholesale. Average order: $5,000-$25,000.

Target margins: 48-52%. The pilot proved 70%.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SLIDE 11: THE ASK

We're not asking for money. We're asking for what money can't buy:

Your mentorship. Your network. Your battle-tested strategy.

We have the product, the proof, and the timing. UBC Venture Founder gives us the foundation to become category leaders.

Let's build this together.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

CLOSING

I'm ready to work. Ready to learn. Ready to build.

Let's make Sneaca the next success story.
