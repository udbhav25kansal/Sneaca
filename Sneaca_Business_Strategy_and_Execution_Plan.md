## Brand & Thesis

### What We Do
**Sneaca** is a turnkey, design-to-door, custom footwear merchandise service. We help brands, teams, and creators bring limited-run shoes to life — from concept and design to manufacturing, packaging, and delivery.

### Why Now
Vancouver hosts **FIFA World Cup matches June–July 2026**, driving a massive wave of global community pride, tourism, and merchandising demand.

**The FIFA campaign is our go-to-market wedge** — not our entire business model, but the first high-impact launchpad to establish credibility, quality, and production rhythm.
