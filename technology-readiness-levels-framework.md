## Overview

Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) are a systematic metric/measurement system that supports assessments of the maturity of a particular technology and the consistent comparison of maturity between different types of technology. The framework consists of nine levels, ranging from basic research to operational deployment.

## The 9 Technology Readiness Levels

### TRL 1: Basic Principles Observed and Reported

**Stage:** Basic Research
**Description:** Scientific research begins to be translated into applied research and development. Initial observations of theoretical concepts occur at this foundational stage.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Fundamental research
- Scientific observation of basic principles
- Paper studies of technology's basic properties
- No experimental proof or detailed analysis

**Example:** Scientific paper proposing that a certain material could improve shoe manufacturing efficiency

---

### TRL 2: Technology Concept and/or Application Formulated

**Stage:** Concept Formation
**Description:** Invention begins. Once basic principles are observed, practical applications can be invented. Work remains limited to analytical studies without physical prototypes.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Practical applications are identified
- Invention begins based on basic principles
- Analytical studies only (no experimental proof)
- Conceptual design of application

**Example:** Conceptual design showing how AI could generate custom shoe designs based on brand inputs

---

### TRL 3: Analytical and Experimental Critical Function and/or Characteristic Proof of Concept

**Stage:** Proof of Concept
**Description:** Active research and development is initiated. This includes analytical studies and/or laboratory studies to physically validate the analytical predictions of separate elements of the technology.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Active R&D begins
- Laboratory studies to validate predictions
- Components exist separately but not integrated
- Proof-of-concept validation

**Example:** AI model successfully generates shoe designs in a lab environment; manufacturing process tested on single components

---

### TRL 4: Component and/or Validation in Laboratory Environment

**Stage:** Laboratory Validation
**Description:** Basic technological components are integrated to establish that they will work together. This is relatively "low fidelity" compared to the eventual system.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Basic components integrated
- Laboratory environment testing
- Ad hoc hardware assembled
- Validation that pieces work together

**Example:** AI design system connected to CAD-CAM software; test manufacturing of sample shoe components

---

### TRL 5: Component and/or Breadboard Validation in Relevant Environment

**Stage:** Simulated Environment Testing
**Description:** The basic technological components are integrated so that the system configuration is similar to its final application. Laboratory integration advances toward realistic conditions.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Fidelity of system increases significantly
- Testing in relevant/simulated environment
- Components integrated into system
- Realistic operating conditions simulated

**Example:** Full design-to-manufacturing workflow tested with simulated customer orders; sample products manufactured

---

### TRL 6: System/Subsystem Model or Prototype Demonstration in a Relevant Environment

**Stage:** Prototype Demonstration
**Description:** A model or prototype that represents a near desired configuration undergoes testing in a simulated operational setting. Represents a major step up in technology demonstration readiness.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Engineering prototype or model
- Near-final configuration
- Tested in simulated operational environment
- High-fidelity prototype

**Example:** Complete end-to-end system tested with beta customers; full custom shoe order processed from design through delivery

---

### TRL 7: System Prototype Demonstration in an Operational Environment

**Stage:** Operational Prototype
**Description:** Prototype at planned operational level and is ready for demonstration in an operational environment. Represents a major step up from TRL 6, requiring demonstration of an actual system prototype in an operational environment.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Prototype in operational environment
- Actual operational conditions
- Near or at scale of operational system
- Field testing in real-world conditions

**Example:** Multiple customer orders processed successfully; Red Thread Club pilot ($700 order, 7-day delivery, 70% margin)

---

### TRL 8: Actual System Completed and Qualified Through Test and Demonstration

**Stage:** Qualified Technology
**Description:** Technology has been proven to work in its final form and under expected conditions. The technology has been proven through test and demonstration.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Actual system completed and qualified
- Proven through developmental testing
- Works in final form
- Demonstrated under expected conditions

**Example:** Production system processing 10-20 customer orders; consistent quality, delivery times, and margins achieved

---

### TRL 9: Actual System Proven Through Successful Mission Operations

**Stage:** Operational Deployment
**Description:** Actual application of the technology in its final form and under real-life conditions, such as those encountered in operational missions. Represents full implementation success.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Full operational deployment
- Technology in final form
- Real-life operating conditions
- Proven successful track record

**Example:** Hundreds of customer orders fulfilled; established market presence; repeatable, scalable operations

## How to Use This Framework

### For Assessment:

1. **Identify Current TRL:** Assess where your technology currently stands based on the characteristics above
2. **Define Target TRL:** Determine what level you need to reach for your goals (funding, commercialization, etc.)
3. **Gap Analysis:** Identify what needs to be accomplished to move from current to target TRL
4. **Plan Development:** Create actionable steps to advance through TRL levels

### For Funding Applications:

- **Early-stage funding:** Typically targets TRL 3-5
- **Commercialization funding:** Often requires TRL 6-7
- **Scale-up funding:** Usually requires TRL 7-8
- **Operational support:** May require TRL 8-9

### Key Principles:

- **Sequential Progress:** Generally must progress through levels sequentially
- **Evidence Required:** Each level requires concrete evidence of achievement
- **Risk Reduction:** Higher TRLs indicate lower technical risk
- **Investment Readiness:** Higher TRLs attract larger investments and commercial partners

## Application to Sneaca

When assessing Sneaca's technology readiness, consider these distinct technology components:

1. **Manufacturing Technology** (physical production capability)
2. **AI Design System** (software for generating manufacturable designs)
3. **End-to-End Service Platform** (integrated workflow from order to delivery)
4. **Quality Control Systems** (processes ensuring consistent output)

Each component may be at a different TRL, and the overall system readiness is typically characterized by the lowest TRL among critical components.
