# 1. Executive Summary

## What is Sneaca?

**Sneaca is the first turnkey custom footwear merchandising service that makes small-batch, fully customized shoes accessible to communities, corporations, influencers, and brands.**

### The Gap We're Filling:

Everyone loves custom merchandise. Companies, communities, and creators have been buying:
- Custom hats and caps
- Custom t-shirts
- Custom sweatshirts and jackets
- Custom pants
- All kinds of branded apparel

**But custom shoes? That hasn't been done at small volumes. Until now.**

### What Makes This Hard:

Custom footwear in small batches is operationally complex:
- High tooling costs
- Quality assurance challenges
- Minimum order quantities (usually 1,000+ pairs)
- Long lead times
- Technical manufacturing expertise required

**Most buyers default to apparel because footwear has been inaccessible.**

### Our Breakthrough:

We've solved this problem through:
1. **Family factory advantage** - Direct access to cutting-edge manufacturing
2. **Small-batch SOPs** - Purpose-built processes for 40-2,000 pairs
3. **Design-to-door service** - We handle everything from concept to delivery
4. **Fast turnaround** - 45-60 day delivery for shoes, 15-30 days for flip-flops

---

## The Mission

**Create solidarity. Bring people together.**

When a community wears matching custom shoes, it creates:
- Visual unity and belonging
- Shared identity
- Memorable experiences
- Stronger community bonds

Whether it's a running club, a tech community, a university, or a hotel brand - **custom footwear is the new badge of belonging.**

---

## Three Primary Market Directions

### 1. Communities & Associations

### 3. FIFA 2026 & Event-Based Merchandise
Country-based pride merchandise, tournament capsules, city celebrations

### Plus: B2B Corporate Customers
Hotels (amenity programs), restaurants (branded flip-flops), clubs, spas, attractions, conferences

---

## The Numbers (First 90 Days)

- **Target Revenue:** $100,000 booked
- **Gross Margin:** ≥48%
- **Orders:** 38-40 deals
- **Average Order Value:** $2,100-$5,200
- **MOQs:** 50 pairs flip-flops, 40-50 pairs sneakers
- **Lead Time:** 45 days (air) shoes, 15 days (air) flip-flops

---

# 2. The Core Problem & Solution

## The Problem: Custom Footwear is Broken

### Current State of Custom Merchandise:

**Apparel (Easy & Common):**
- ✅ Low MOQs (25-50 pieces)
- ✅ Fast turnaround (7-14 days)
- ✅ Simple customization
- ✅ Many suppliers available
- ✅ Affordable pricing

**Footwear (Hard & Rare):**
- ❌ High MOQs (1,000+ pairs)
- ❌ Long lead times (120+ days)
- ❌ Complex manufacturing
- ❌ Few suppliers willing to do small batches
- ❌ Expensive setup costs

### What This Means for Customers:

**Communities can't get custom shoes** because:
- A running club of 50 members can't order 1,000 pairs
- A startup with 100 employees can't justify the investment
- An influencer testing a product line needs 50-200 pairs, not 1,000
- A hotel chain wants 200 pairs per location, not 10,000

**The result:** They settle for generic shoes or skip footwear entirely.

## What This Means for the Business

### Our Moat:

**This isn't something competitors can replicate easily.**

Most custom merchandise companies trying to enter footwear would need to:

**We skip all of that.**

### Operational Advantages:

1. **Small-Batch SOPs**
   - We've built processes specifically for 50-2,000 pairs
   - Most factories optimize for 5,000+ pairs
   - Our sweet spot is where others can't compete

2. **Quality Predictability**
   - We know exactly what we'll get
   - First Pass Yield target: ≥98.5%
   - Consistent quality across orders
   - Fast iteration on issues

3. **Speed as Advantage**
   - 45-day lead times (industry standard: 90-120 days)
   - Fast approvals and communication
   - Rush orders possible (not typical)

4. **Design Integration**
   - Seamless design-to-tech-pack workflow
   - In-house understanding of manufacturing constraints
   - Can push creative boundaries
   - Fast proof turnaround (72 hours)

### Margin Protection Strategy

**Target:** Maintain ≥50% blended gross margin

**Tactics:**

1. **Focus on Higher-Tier Orders**
   - Prioritize 40-249 pair orders (shoes)
   - Push 50-249 pair orders (flip-flops)
   - These have best margin profiles

2. **Reduce Costs for Large Orders**
   - Negotiate better rates at volume
   - Economy specs (materials/overlays) for price-sensitive large orders
   - Sea freight (vs air) to reduce costs

3. **Add Setup Fees for Large Tiers**
   - $500-$1,500 setup fee on 500+ orders
   - Effectively adds $1-$3 per pair
   - Protects margin without changing headline price

4. **Rush Fees**
   - +20% for rush orders (subject to capacity)
   - Covers air freight premium
   - Incentivizes normal timelines

5. **Mix Management**
   - Balance high-margin and low-margin orders
   - Target: 60% revenue from 40-249 tier
   - 40% revenue from larger tiers
