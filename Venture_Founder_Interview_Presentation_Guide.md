## Slide 3: Venture Name (~60 secs)

### Give us a 60-second introduction to your venture opportunity

**Key Elements:**
- Briefly describe the compelling problem you are solving and who has it (the customer or user, or someone else?)
- Briefly describe how your innovation will solve the compelling problem, and
- Tell us how or why your solution benefits the customer more than the competitive solutions that are also trying to solve the problem (not the technical features, but the benefits to the customer)

**For inspiration, see:**
- Simon Sinek's Start with Why
- Jake Mendel's TechStars blog post "So What's Your Problem Anyway"

**Example format:**

"We're [venture name] and we're [changing / eliminating / helping / improving etc] how [a specific user or customer] [does X / manages Y / lives with Z (describe the problem)] by [describe your solution]. We are differentiated from [describe competitive solutions] because [describe why your solution is better for the user/customer]."

## Slide 4: Team (~30 secs)

### Introduce your team

**Required Information:**
- Briefly identify the skills or background for each team member
- Include their connection to UBC (if any)
- Identify the venture commitment for each team member (full-time, part-time, # of hours per week, area of work, etc.)
  - **Note:** Please be realistic about your commitment. If you and your team are full-time employees of UBC or another organization, it may be challenging for others to believe you can devote full-time hours to your startup. Please provide specifics about your current situation.

**Tip:** If you have time, add your vision for how the world will be changed after your solution is adopted.

## Slide 5: Problem (~30 secs)

### Provide your problem statement

**Key Elements:**
- What specific problem are you solving, and for whom?
- Make it compelling and relatable
- Consider telling a story to explain the problem
- A picture is worth a thousand words. Can you illustrate your problem statement with a picture?

**Important:** *Make sure the description of the problem does not include a description of your solution*

## Slide 6: How the Problem is Solved Today (~45 secs)

**Key Elements:**
- Tell us how the problem is currently solved (or avoided) today, & why the current solution (technology / products / services / avoidance / status quo) fails to address the problem
- **Make your description as simple, clear, and concise as possible.** What is the key takeaway message you want your audience to remember. You only have around 45 seconds to get this message across.

## Slide 7: Market Size (~45 secs)

**Key Questions to Address:**

1. **How many (potential) customers are there?**
   - Be sure to describe the boundaries of this number (annual recurring number or total number? Geographic or demographic limitations, patient population, number of B2B partners, etc)

2. **How much is each customer worth?**
   - How much will they pay for your solution?

3. **How big is the market?**
   - (number of customers X price they will each pay)
   - Be sure to identify if this is the total market over the life of the product/company, or a renewable market (ie. will your customers buy a replacement product/service each year (or more frequently), is it a subscription?)
   - Make sure to note any assumptions you had to make to arrive at a total market estimate

## Slide 8: Product/Service & Intellectual Property (~45 secs)

### What's your solution to the Problem:

**Key Elements:**
- How does it work
- Who is your product for, and what benefits does it provide?
- Insert a picture of your product or service if helpful to simplify your explanation
- If applicable, include a non-confidential description of any patents or patent applications that cover your product or service (if applicable). Include the type of patent or patent application and any upcoming deadlines. Please indicate whether you believe you have UBC IP or not.
- Do not include confidential information that is not covered by a patent application (as members of UBC, we are all covered by confidentiality, but we are being extra careful here)

## Slide 9: Technology Readiness Level (~45 secs)

**Requirement:**
- Estimate the maturity of your **product or service** (not the underlying technology) using Technology Readiness Level (TRL)
